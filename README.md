# NeuroSuitUp
 Software and mixed signal electronics developer and tester. This Biomedical Engineering project is funded by the Greek government and aims to create an exoskeletal jacket and glove which will assist in Neural Rehabilitation for patients who suffer from paralysis. The hardware we are developing both senses a patient’s movement and intention to move, as well as electrically stimulates the muscles to support the intended movement. It aims to engage the brain’s natural capacity for neuroplasticity and adaptation, for Neural Rehabilitation purposes. Ongoing. Supervised by Dr. Alexander Astaras (ACT, AUTH) and Dr. Alkinoos Athanasiou (AUTH).  In association with the Aristotle university of Thessaloniki. https://medphys.med.auth.gr/project/neurosuitup.
